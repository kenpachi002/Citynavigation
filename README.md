City Navigation System

This is a graph-based mini project implemented using C and Python.
The C code handles backend graph logic and algorithms, while Python
provides a simple GUI for interaction.

Requirements:
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)

To run:
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Run the following commands:
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install networkx
3. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
4. Open frontend/city_nav_gui.py
5. Run the file (Run button or Ctrl + F5)

Note:
Do not run the exe file directly. It is used internally by the GUI.
